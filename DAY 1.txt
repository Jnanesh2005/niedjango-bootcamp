Introduction To DataBase:-
       A database is a collection of interrelated data that helps in the efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data from the database and organizes the data in the form of tables,
       views, schemas, reports, etc. For Example, a university database organizes the data about students, faculty, admin staff, etc. which helps in the efficient retrieval, insertion, and 
       deletion of data from it.

Intruduction to MYSQL:-
       *)MySQL is a relational database management system.
       *)MySQL is cross-platform.
       *)MySQL is very fast, reliable, scalable, and easy to use.
       *)MySQL is ideal for both small and large applications.

Introduction to NOSQL:-
       *)Non-Relational are designed to handle a wide variety of data models, including document, key-value, wide-column, and graph formats. 
       *)Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases are known for their flexible schemas for unstructured data, scalability, and ease of use for developers.

Queries TO Perform if MYSQL Work Bench:-
       *)Creating a Database:- CREATE DATABASE database_name;
       *)Selecting a Database:- USE database_name;.
       *)Creating a Table:- CREATE TABLE table_name (column_definitions);
       *)Inserting Data:-INSERT INTO table_name (columns) VALUES (values);
       *)Updating Data:-UPDATE table_name SET column = value WHERE condition;
       *)Deleting Data: DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
       *)Querying specfic Data: SELECT columns FROM table_name WHERE condition;
       *)Retrieving All Data: SELECT * FROM table_name;
       *)Counting Records: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;
       *)Finding Maximum Value: SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;
       *)Inner_Joining Tables: SELECT column_name(s)  FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
